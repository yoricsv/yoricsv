# **Hello, guest!** <br/> Thanks for your interest :raising_hand:
-

- Hello, I'm Sergey.

- I am interested in working with embedded systems based on ARM-Cortex (for example: STMicroelectronics microcontrollers),
in addition, since childhood, I was really interested in electronics. I designed and assembled simple electronic devices,
but I didn't have enough tools and sources of components (few electronic stores). First of all, in my environment there
was no one who would be interested in this, like me. Now I am studying programming in C, C++, C# and it's really cool.
In the near future I want to learn Java, Python for AI.   

- I am currently learning C, C++ and sometimes spend a little time learning C#.

- I'm looking for someone who understands that he might get a good software engineer in the future.
